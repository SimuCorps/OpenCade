  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>But Dishpit, the Heroic Launcher is already a thing. Why not just use that?</summary>
    <p>Shut the fuck up, I don't care. Why not just use that, really?? Why not do anything? Why admire a butterfly in the distance, or enjoy the smell of fresh dew, or stare in awe at a sunrise during your morning run? I'm doing this because I can, and because I love programming.</p>
    <p>Fuck you.</p>

    <p>Fuck clankers.</p>
